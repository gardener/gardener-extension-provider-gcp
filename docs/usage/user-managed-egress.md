# User-Managed Egress (BYO Subnet Mode)

By default the GCP provider extension creates and manages all network infrastructure for a shoot cluster: VPC, worker subnet, Cloud Router, and Cloud NAT gateway.
**BYO subnet mode** lets you opt out of this management and bring your own pre-provisioned VPC and subnets.
Gardener will use — but never create, modify, or delete — your VPC and subnet(s).
You own the egress topology entirely.

Gardener still manages the following on your behalf in BYO mode:

- **CCM-authored firewall rules and custom routes** — the in-cluster Cloud Controller Manager creates `k8s-fw-*` firewall rules per `Service type=LoadBalancer` and `shoot--*` custom routes per node (IPv4 only), and cleans them up when those resources are removed. Gardener sweeps any residuals at shoot deletion time.
- **Bastion firewall rules** — the bastion controller creates three tag-scoped firewall rules when a bastion is requested and removes them when the bastion is deleted.

## When to use this

- You need a specific egress design (user-owned Cloud NAT, NVA/VPN route, private cluster with no default route).
- Multiple shoot clusters must share a single VPC and subnet.
- Your organization's security policy requires audited, infrastructure-as-code-managed network resources.
- You want to reuse an existing subnet that was provisioned outside of Gardener.

## How it works

Setting `networks.subnetWorkers` in `InfrastructureConfig` activates BYO subnet mode.
Gardener detects this and switches the infrastructure reconciler to a read-only path for your network resources:

- The worker subnet, Cloud Router, Cloud NAT, and the four static firewall rules are **not created**.
- At reconciliation time Gardener verifies the referenced VPC and subnet(s) exist; it does not mutate them.
- At shoot deletion Gardener **does not delete** the BYO VPC or subnets.

The in-cluster Cloud Controller Manager still writes firewall rules and custom routes into your VPC at runtime — see [What Gardener writes into your VPC at runtime](#what-gardener-writes-into-your-vpc-at-runtime).

## Configuration

### Single-stack IPv4

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: InfrastructureConfig
networks:
  vpc:
    name: my-vpc          # must exist before shoot creation
  subnetWorkers:
    name: my-workers      # must exist before shoot creation
```

Corresponding shoot spec:

```yaml
spec:
  networking:
    ipFamilies: [IPv4]
    nodes:    10.100.0.0/16
    pods:     10.96.0.0/11
    services: 10.200.0.0/20
```

The worker subnet's primary IPv4 range must **contain** `shoot.spec.networking.nodes` and must not overlap with `shoot.spec.networking.pods` or `shoot.spec.networking.services`.

### Dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6)

```yaml
apiVersion: gcp.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: InfrastructureConfig
networks:
  vpc:
    name: my-vpc
  subnetWorkers:
    name: my-workers
    podSecondaryRangeName: my-pods   # name of the secondary range on my-workers
  subnetServices:
    name: my-services
```

Corresponding shoot spec:

```yaml
spec:
  networking:
    ipFamilies: [IPv4, IPv6]
    nodes:    10.100.0.0/16
    pods:     10.96.0.0/11
    services: 10.200.0.0/20
```

See [Pre-provisioning — dual-stack](#pre-provisioning--dual-stack) for the exact subnet requirements.

## Pre-provisioning

### Pre-provisioning — single-stack IPv4

**1. Create the VPC** (skip if reusing an existing one):

```bash
gcloud compute networks create my-vpc \
  --project=<project> \
  --subnet-mode=custom
```

**2. Create the worker subnet:**

```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets create my-workers \
  --project=<project> \
  --network=my-vpc \
  --region=<region> \
  --range=10.100.0.0/16
```

The primary range (`--range`) must be inside `shoot.spec.networking.nodes` and must not overlap with `shoot.spec.networking.pods` or `shoot.spec.networking.services`.

**3. Create firewall rules** (see [Required firewall rules — single-stack](#required-firewall-rules--single-stack)).

**4. Provision egress** of your choice, for example a user-owned Cloud NAT:

```bash
gcloud compute routers create my-router \
  --project=<project> \
  --network=my-vpc \
  --region=<region>

gcloud compute routers nats create my-nat \
  --project=<project> \
  --router=my-router \
  --region=<region> \
  --nat-all-subnet-ip-ranges \
  --auto-allocate-nat-external-ips
```

### Pre-provisioning — dual-stack

**1. Create the VPC** (skip if reusing an existing one):

```bash
gcloud compute networks create my-vpc \
  --project=<project> \
  --subnet-mode=custom
```

**2. Create the worker subnet with dual-stack and a secondary range for pods:**

```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets create my-workers \
  --project=<project> \
  --network=my-vpc \
  --region=<region> \
  --range=10.100.0.0/16 \
  --stack-type=IPV4_IPV6 \
  --ipv6-access-type=EXTERNAL \
  --secondary-range=my-pods=10.96.0.0/11
```

Requirements:
- `--range` must contain `shoot.spec.networking.nodes` and must not overlap with pods or services CIDRs.
- `--secondary-range` name must match `subnetWorkers.podSecondaryRangeName`; its CIDR must **exactly equal** `shoot.spec.networking.pods`.
- `--stack-type=IPV4_IPV6` and `--ipv6-access-type=EXTERNAL` are required so GCP assigns an external `/64` IPv6 CIDR.

**3. Create the services subnet:**

```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets create my-services \
  --project=<project> \
  --network=my-vpc \
  --region=<region> \
  --range=192.168.255.0/29 \
  --stack-type=IPV4_IPV6 \
  --ipv6-access-type=EXTERNAL
```

The primary IPv4 range is required by GCP but is not used by Gardener — choose any small non-overlapping range.
`--stack-type=IPV4_IPV6` and `--ipv6-access-type=EXTERNAL` are required.

**4. Create firewall rules** (see [Required firewall rules — dual-stack](#required-firewall-rules--dual-stack)).

**5. Provision egress** of your choice (same as single-stack, or configure IPv6 egress via Cloud NAT or Internet Gateway as needed).

## Required firewall rules

Gardener does not create the static firewall rules in BYO mode.
You must pre-provision rules that cover the same traffic paths.

Replace `<technicalID>` with the shoot's technical ID (e.g. `shoot--myproject--mycluster`).
You can find this value in `shoot.status.technicalID` after shoot creation, but since you need the rules before creation you can derive it from the shoot name: `shoot--<project>--<name>`.

Using `--target-tags=<technicalID>` scopes rules to shoot worker VMs only — recommended for shared VPCs.
Omit `--target-tags` to make the rules apply to all VMs on the VPC (matches today's managed-mode behavior).

### Required firewall rules — single-stack

```bash
# Allow intra-shoot traffic (node-to-node, pod-to-node via VPC routes)
# In single-stack mode pods are routed via per-node VPC routes — only the nodes CIDR is needed.
gcloud compute firewall-rules create <name>-allow-internal \
  --project=<project> \
  --network=my-vpc \
  --direction=INGRESS \
  --priority=1000 \
  --source-ranges=<networks.workers> \
  --target-tags=<technicalID> \
  --rules=icmp,ipip,tcp:1-65535,udp:1-65535

# Allow GCP load-balancer health-check probes
gcloud compute firewall-rules create <name>-allow-health-checks \
  --project=<project> \
  --network=my-vpc \
  --direction=INGRESS \
  --priority=1000 \
  --source-ranges=35.191.0.0/16,130.211.0.0/22,209.85.152.0/22,209.85.204.0/22 \
  --target-tags=<technicalID> \
  --rules=tcp:30000-32767,udp:30000-32767
```

### Required firewall rules — dual-stack

Dual-stack shoots additionally require IPv6 mirrors.
Retrieve the IPv6 CIDRs assigned to your subnets after creation:

```bash
gcloud compute networks subnets describe my-workers --project=<project> --region=<region> --format='value(externalIpv6Prefix)'
gcloud compute networks subnets describe my-services --project=<project> --region=<region> --format='value(externalIpv6Prefix)'
```

```bash
# IPv4 rules (same as single-stack above)
gcloud compute firewall-rules create <name>-allow-internal ...
gcloud compute firewall-rules create <name>-allow-health-checks ...

# IPv6 intra-shoot traffic
gcloud compute firewall-rules create <name>-allow-internal-ipv6 \
  --project=<project> \
  --network=my-vpc \
  --direction=INGRESS \
  --priority=1000 \
  --source-ranges=<workers-ipv6-cidr>,<services-ipv6-cidr> \
  --target-tags=<technicalID> \
  --rules=ipv6-icmp,ipip,tcp:1-65535,udp:1-65535

# IPv6 GCP load-balancer health-check probes
gcloud compute firewall-rules create <name>-allow-health-checks-ipv6 \
  --project=<project> \
  --network=my-vpc \
  --direction=INGRESS \
  --priority=1000 \
  --source-ranges=2600:2d00:1:b029::/64,2600:2d00:1:1::/64,2600:1901:8001::/48 \
  --target-tags=<technicalID> \
  --rules=tcp:30000-32767,udp:30000-32767
```

## Required IAM permissions

Gardener's GCP principal (the service account referenced by the shoot's `SecretBinding`/`CredentialsBinding`) still needs project-level IAM permissions to manage CCM-authored firewall rules and custom routes at runtime:

| Permission | Reason |
|---|---|
| `compute.firewalls.create`, `compute.firewalls.update`, `compute.firewalls.delete` | CCM creates/deletes `k8s-fw-*` rules per `Service type=LoadBalancer` |
| `compute.routes.create`, `compute.routes.delete` | CCM writes per-node pod-CIDR routes (single-stack IPv4 only) |
| `compute.networks.get`, `compute.subnetworks.get` | Infrastructure reconciler verifies BYO resources exist |

The full permissions list for the shoot service account is unchanged from managed mode.
The above highlights the subset that remains relevant in BYO mode.

## What Gardener writes into your VPC at runtime

Activating BYO subnet mode does not prevent Gardener's in-cluster controllers from writing into your VPC.
The table below describes every write that can occur after shoot creation.

| Component | Runs in | Writes to your VPC | Cleaned up by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MCM** | seed | Creates/deletes worker VMs in the nodes subnet; attaches network tags (`<technicalID>`, `kubernetes-io-cluster-<technicalID>`, `kubernetes-io-role-node`) to every VM NIC | MCM on scale-down / node deletion |
| **CCM (IPv4 routing)** | shoot | Creates one `shoot--*` custom route per node for pod-CIDR routing (single-stack IPv4 only) | `ensureKubernetesRoutesDeleted` on shoot delete; CCM on node deletion |
| **CCM (LoadBalancer)** | shoot | Creates `k8s-fw-<hash>` firewall rule + `k8s-<hash>-hc` health-check rule per `Service type=LoadBalancer`, scoped by tag to `<technicalID>` VMs | CCM on Service delete |
| **`ingress-gce`** | seed (dual-stack only) | Creates `k8s-fw-l7-*` firewall rules + global forwarding rules, backend services, health checks, NEGs | `ingress-gce` on Ingress/Service delete; residual firewall rules swept by `ensureFirewallRulesDeleted` on shoot delete |
| **Bastion controller** | seed | Creates bastion VM + disk + NIC in the nodes subnet; creates three tag-scoped firewall rules for SSH access | Bastion controller on Bastion CR delete |
| **Infrastructure reconciler (delete)** | seed | Removes residual CCM-authored `k8s-fw-*` firewall rules and `shoot--*` custom routes at shoot deletion time | — |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not run competing automation against the CCM-authored `k8s-fw-*` firewall rules or `shoot--*` custom routes.
> These resources are managed by the in-cluster CCM lifecycle; external interference will cause reconciliation errors or broken networking.

## Immutability

`networks.subnetWorkers` cannot be added to or removed from an existing shoot.
The subnet name and `podSecondaryRangeName` are immutable once the shoot is created.

To change the subnet you must delete the shoot and create a new one.

## Status fields

In BYO mode `shoot.status.provider.egressCIDRs` is always empty.
Egress IPs are managed entirely by your own egress topology and are not reported by Gardener.

## Deletion / teardown

On shoot deletion Gardener:

- **Does not delete** your VPC, worker subnet, or services subnet.
- **Does not delete** your Cloud Router or Cloud NAT (they were never created).
- **Does not delete** the four static firewall rules you created during pre-provisioning (they were never created by Gardener).
- **Does delete** CCM-authored `k8s-fw-*` firewall rules (filter: `k8s` prefix + `TargetTag` = shoot technical ID).
- **Does delete** CCM-authored `shoot--*` custom routes (single-stack IPv4 only).

If the shoot is force-deleted or the CCM crashes before it can clean up its firewall rules or custom routes, those resources will remain in your VPC.
Check for and remove any residual `k8s-fw-<hash>` rules and `shoot--*` routes after forced shoot deletion.
